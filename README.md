# Pokémon Personality Test


**AUTHOR NOTES:**
* This project was 100% done for fun and for exploring full stack web development
* The project idea is actually inspired by [BuzzFeed](
https://www.buzzfeed.com/tag/which-character-are-you) style quizzes
* Certain keys were removed for privacy so a clone without modifications will not result in a working application 


**TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:**
* Developed a form which tells users which pokémon they are most like based on a Myers–Briggs type indicator 
* Paired Python back-end with Flask, stored answers with PostgreSQL, and manipulated data from the PokéAPI
